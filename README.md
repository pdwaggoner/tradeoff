# `tradeoff`: Calculating tradeoffs in decision-making based on aggregate behavior

## This measure is introduced and validated in a paper currently _Under Review_. Please be sure to let me know if you want to use or work with this. Any ideas on making it better are always welcomed.

## Why should I use `tradeoff`?

First some background. Then, what does the package do intuitively?

## How do I use `tradeoff`?

The idea behind this package. To see how this works, consider a few examples.

###### First, load the package and run the library

```{r }
# First load the package via the tarball/zip file (as this package is in development and not released on CRAN yet)
library(tradeoff)
```

###### Example

```{r }
# Here is an example/plot
```

The output is here.

## How do I get `tradeoff`?

You can get the code for the package here at my GitHub Repo (soon). This measure/package is \[very much\] a work in progress.
